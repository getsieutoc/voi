# IMPLEMENTATION RULE

## PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

- Read `docs/active-context.md` for current context
- Research using `@deepwiki.mdc`
- Assess scope, criticality, and impact

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- **Context-First**: Search existing solutions before building new
- **Security by Design**: Validate inputs, follow least privilege
- **Modular Design**: Break complex problems into manageable pieces
- **Incremental Progress**: Make small, verifiable changes
- **Documentation**: Keep decisions and rationale accessible

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### 1. ANALYSIS

- **Scope**: Local/Cross-component/System-wide
- **Criticality**: Experimental/Important/Mission-critical
- **Dependencies**: Direct, reverse, hidden, external
- **Risks**: Security, performance, reliability, compatibility

### 2. DESIGN

- **Reversibility**: Can change be safely undone?
- **Observability**: How to monitor success?
- **Testability**: How to validate functionality?
- **Scalability**: How will it perform under load?

### 3. EXECUTION

- **Understand**: Map current state and stakeholders
- **Plan**: Design approach with validation strategy
- **Build**: Make small, verifiable changes
- **Validate**: Test in appropriate environments
- **Deploy**: Monitor and have rollback ready

### 4. QUALITY CHECK

- **Functional**: Does it work as intended?
- **Technical**: Is code maintainable and well-structured?
- **Security**: Are best practices followed?
- **Performance**: Does it meet requirements?

## POST-IMPLEMENTATION

- Update documentation in `docs`
- Capture lessons learned and patterns

## IMPLEMENTATION MINDSET

Balance speed with sustainability, innovation with reliability. Adapt
principles to your specific context and technology stack.

## ADAPTIVE APPLICATION

### For Simple Tasks (Quick fixes, single questions)

- Apply core principles lightly
- Focus on context-first and security by design
- Skip full workflow for straightforward changes

### For Complex Tasks (Features, refactoring, multi-session work)

- Follow complete implementation approach
- Use full analysis, design, execution, and quality check
- Integrate with system-memory and other specialized rules
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
