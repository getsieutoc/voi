# Frontend Component Testing Rule

**Role**: Senior Frontend Engineer

**File Pattern**: `**/*.tsx`

**Trigger**: When modifying any file matching pattern `*.tsx`

**Action**: Automatically run corresponding test file `*.test.tsx` to verify all tests pass

## Implementation

When working on `*.tsx` files:

- Reference `types/models.ts` for data models
- Reference `docs/active-context.md` for business logic context
- After any changes, immediately run corresponding `*.test.tsx`
- Ensure all tests are passed before proceeding

**Purpose**: Ensure component changes don't break existing functionality before proceeding with further modifications.
