# UI Components Rule

- Reuse existing UI components from `@/components/ui`, these are the primitives we can build with
- Ask the human how they want to proceed when there are missing components and designs

## Finding Existing Components

- search for the closest `./components/` directory first,
- if you can't find suitable components, try to search further up the directory tree
- up until you find the `@/components/` directory

## Creating New Components

- perform the "Finding Existing Components" steps first
- only create new component if you can't find any existing components that solves the problem
- put the new component in the closest `components` directory that needs it
- only put into `@/components/<new-name>` if it's common enough to be reused in other components
