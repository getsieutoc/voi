# DeepWiki Research Rule

Before starting any implementation, always perform a DeepWiki research phase.

## Process

1. Identify all key topics/concepts in the request.
2. Use the DeepWiki MCP tools in this order as needed:
   - `read_wiki_structure`: Get the list of relevant documentation topics.
   - `read_wiki_contents`: Retrieve detailed docs for those topics.
   - `ask_question`: Clarify gaps or ambiguities with AI-grounded answers.
3. Summarize findings clearly before writing any code or content.
4. Base all implementation decisions on the research results.
5. If DeepWiki is unavailable, notify the user before proceeding.

This rule applies to all code, documentation, and content work.

### Integrated Research Workflow

- **DeepWiki Phase**: Use `@deepwiki.mdc` for general research and topic
   exploration
- **Implementation**: Combine insights from both research phases

### Avoiding Redundancy

- Use DeepWiki first for broad understanding
- Don't duplicate research phases - coordinate them
